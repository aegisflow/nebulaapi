## Custom MIT License for NebulaAPI (With Protections for Scalability and Modularity)

Copy this text into a file named **LICENSE** or **LICENSE.md** at the root of the repo. It is the standard MIT license (permissive for forks/contributions), but with custom additions to protect your unique idea (respect for essence, mandatory attribution, no resale without permission, disclaimer). This allows for growth via snowball (forks/PRs) while safeguarding scalable modularity for premium/enterprise. Based on official MIT templates (MIT License 2025) and clauses from projects like VS Code (Microsoft, with strict attribution).

### Specific Additions for Idea Protection and Scalability:

- **Mandatory Attribution**: Every copy, fork, modification, or distribution must include the above copyright notice and this full license, explicitly mentioning the original creator (aegisflow/nebulaapi) as the source of the modular and scalable idea of NebulaAPI. Removal or alteration of this attribution violates the license.

- **Respect for Unique Idea**: The license allows for use and modifications for personal or educational purposes but prohibits reverse engineering, extraction, or use of the conceptual essence (zero-state architecture, scalable modularity) for competitive or commercial purposes without explicit written authorization from the creator. Contributions via PRs are welcome for collaborative growth, but paid derivatives require a separate premium license.

- **Limited Commercial Use**: Forks and free distributions are allowed for non-commercial use. For resale, integration into paid products, or enterprise negotiations, obtain explicit commercial license from the creator (via [link to Lemon Squeezy or approved contact]).
