Feedback Priority (Replacing Rewards)

> **Priority:** Detailed bug reports (using the provided `bug_report.md` template) and suggestions for optimizing automation are the most valuable forms of contribution at this time. As the project is maintained by a solo developer and is focused on stability, feedback regarding security, failures, and the efficiency of the Worker runtime is our primary goal.

## Legal and Authorization Considerations

This project is distributed under the MIT license for personal use and open contributions, but all legal aspects must be strictly respected. Any action beyond personal use—including contributions that alter the core, forks for commercial purposes, sales of derivatives, or negotiations with companies—requires **explicit authorization from the creator** (in writing, via an approved pull request, or approved direct contact). The creator reserves all rights to the essence of the project, and violations may result in access revocation or legal action. Contributions are welcome for collaborative growth, but always aligned with the open-source spirit without competing or lucrative intentions without approval.
