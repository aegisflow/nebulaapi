# Roadmap of NebulaAPI

Thank you for your interest! This roadmap guides collaborative growth — contribute with PRs to accelerate.

## Planned Versions
- **v1.0 (Done)**: Basic stateless core (generic fetch handler).
- **v1.1 (Next)**: Expanded routing for simple webhooks (suggest features!).
- **v1.2**: Basic payload validation (e.g., JSON safe).
- **v2.0**: Generic integrations (fork and test!).

## How to Contribute to the Roadmap
- Open an issue with an idea (e.g., "Add support for routes").
- PRs are welcome for v1.1 — shoutout in the README.

Let’s snowball together!
